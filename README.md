Hey There!!

Bun 1.0 was released recently so I decided to give it a go!!

This application will be using Bun in the backend for 2 main APIS (HTTP and WSS)
It will use svelte for the frontend, but also Bun

We are going to use Postgres as the main DB and a Redis in order to have some cache.

### Main Table

#### Company

| ID  | Company_Name   | Company_ID   | Company_ID   | created |
|-------------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| UUID    | VARCHAR(255)     | VARCHAR(100)     | DATETIME

#### User

| Column1  | Column2   | Column3   |
|-------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Item1    | Item1     | Item1     |

#### Files

| Column1  | Column2   | Column3   |
|-------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Item1    | Item1     | Item1     |
